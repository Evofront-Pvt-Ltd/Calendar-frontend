# Calendar Frontend CI/CD

Industrial GitOps deployment aligned with the Surveys pattern:

- **CI:** GitHub Actions validates, builds, and pushes Docker images to Docker Hub
- **CD:** Argo CD syncs `k8s/overlays/staging` from the `develop` branch
- **Traceability:** every release is pinned to a Git commit SHA in Kustomize

See [DEPLOY.md](../DEPLOY.md) for bootstrap, secrets, Argo CD registration, and rollback.

## Workflow

| Job | Trigger | Actions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ci` | PR and push to `develop` | typecheck, build, docker build, container smoke test |
| `deploy` | push to `develop` only | push image to Docker Hub, commit manifest image tag |

## GitHub secrets

| Secret | Required |
| --- | --- |
| `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` | Yes |
| `DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD` | Yes |
